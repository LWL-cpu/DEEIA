# DEEIA



Source code for Findings of ACL 2024 paper: [Beyond Single-Event Extraction: Towards Efficient Document-Level Multi-Event Argument Extraction](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-acl.564).

 Our code is based on PAIE [here](https://github.com/mayubo2333/PAIE) and thanks for their implement.

## üî• Introduction

Recent mainstream event argument extraction methods process each event in isolation, resulting in inefficient inference and ignoring the correlations among multiple events. To address these limitations, here we propose a multiple-event argument extraction model DEEIA (Dependency-guided Encoding and Event-specific Information Aggregation), capable of extracting arguments from all events within a document simultaneously. The proposed DEEIA model employs a multi-event prompt mechanism, comprising DE and EIA modules. The DE module is designed to improve the correlation between prompts and their corresponding event contexts, whereas the EIA module provides event-specific information to improve contextual understanding. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets (RAMS, WikiEvents, MLEE, and ACE05), while significantly saving the inference time compared to the baselines. Further analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules.

## üöÄ How to use our code?

# Project Title

This project provides the implementation of **DEEIA**, with support for dataset processing, training, and evaluation.

## 1. Setup Environment

Before starting, ensure you have the required dependencies and environment set up.

### 1.1 Create Conda Environment

First, create a new Conda environment with Python 3.9:

```bash
conda create -n DEEIA python=3.9
conda activate DEEIA
```

### 1.2 Install Dependencies

After activating the environment, install all necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1.3 Install SpaCy Language Model

To enable language processing with SpaCy, download the `en_core_web_sm` model using the following command:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

---

## 2. Data Preprocessing

You can refer to the **PAIE** project [here](https://github.com/mayubo2333/PAIE) to obtain the datasets. 

## 3. Training and Inference

The following scripts can be used to train and evaluate models on different datasets:

### 3.1 Training

You can train models by running the corresponding scripts:

```bash
bash ./scripts/train_wikievent_roberta.sh
bash ./scripts/train_rams_roberta.sh
bash ./scripts/train_mlee_roberta.sh
```

Each script is tailored to a specific dataset and configuration. You may modify the settings inside these scripts to suit your needs.
